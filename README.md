# Game Development with Python
by Kirk Martin, Usman Ahmed, Ed Hawkins, Wayne Tobias

-----

### General Overview
This is intended to be the final unit of the year for our AP CSP classes. It is intended as a bridge from AP CSP to prepare the students for AP CSA. Students will become familiar with text-based coding by using Python to develop games.

---

### Motivation for Unit
We teach AP CSP using the Beauty and Joy of Computing curriculum. BJC utilizes the Snap! block-based coding language. We want to take advantage of the instructional time after the AP test to introduce the students to text-based coding. We chose to use Python and focus on game design to keep the material as simple and engaging as possible while still maintaining sufficient rigor to adequately prepare the students for AP CSA.

### Standards Referenced
9-12.CT.1 Create a simple digital model that makes predictions of outcomes.

9-12.CT.4 Implement a program using a combination of student-defined and third-party functions to organize the computation.

9-12.CT.7 Design or remix a program that utilizes a data structure to maintain changes to related pieces of data.

9-12.CT.8 Develop a program that effectively uses control structures in order to create a computer program for practical intent, personal expression, or to address a societal issue.

9-12.CT.9 Systematically test and refine programs using a range of test cases, based on anticipating common errors and user behavior.

9-12.CT.10 Collaboratively design and develop a program or computational artifact for a specific audience and create documentation outlining implementation features to inform collaborators and users.

9-12.DL.2 Communicate and work collaboratively with others using digital tools to support individual learning and contribute to the learning of others.
